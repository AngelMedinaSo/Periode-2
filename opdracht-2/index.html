    <p>
      When the js file is loaded in head it isn't able to find the tags because
      its loaded before reading all the tags, but if its at the end of body, it
      can read all the tags and then use them.<br />
      The defer attribute in JavaScript, when used with a script tag, instructs
      the browser to download the external JavaScript file in the background
      while continuing to parse the HTML document, without blocking the
      rendering of the page.<br />
      Html is the website skeleton and js is there to make changes, functions
      and more things.<br />
      The primary difference between innerHTML and innerText lies in how they
      handle and return content within an HTML element. innerHTML returns or
      sets the HTML content of an element, including all tags and their
      attributes, treating the content as HTML code that can be parsed and
      rendered by the browser.
